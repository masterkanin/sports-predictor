# Requirements for PrizePicks Sports Predictor Web Interface

## Overview
Create a full web application with backend to display predictions from the Neural Network-Based Sports Predictor for PrizePicks. The application should provide an intuitive interface for users to view, filter, sort, and analyze predictions across multiple sports.

## User Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. Display predictions from the Neural Network-Based Sports Predictor
2. Show all relevant prediction details:
   - Player information (name, team, opponent)
   - Predicted stat value (regression output)
   - Over/under probability (classification output)
   - PrizePicks line
   - Confidence level and uncertainty range
   - Key factors influencing the prediction

### Filtering Capabilities
1. Filter by sport (NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, Soccer)
2. Filter by date (calendar selection, today, tomorrow, this week)
3. Filter by confidence level (Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, Very High)
4. Filter by statistic type (Points, Rebounds, Assists, etc.)
5. Filter by team or player name

### Sorting Options
1. Sort by predicted value (ascending/descending)
2. Sort by over/under probability (ascending/descending)
3. Sort by confidence level (ascending/descending)
4. Sort by player name (alphabetical)
5. Sort by game time (chronological)

### Visualization Features
1. Visual representation of prediction confidence (gauge charts, confidence bars)
2. Visualization of historical performance (line charts, bar charts)
3. Comparison visualizations between predicted and actual values
4. Distribution charts for prediction accuracy
5. Sport-specific performance metrics visualization

### Historical Performance Tracking
1. Track prediction accuracy over time
2. Display historical performance by sport
3. Show performance metrics (accuracy, MSE, MAE, etc.)
4. Compare performance across different time periods
5. Highlight trends and patterns in prediction accuracy

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
1. Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. Modern UI with intuitive navigation
3. Interactive data tables with sorting and filtering
4. Data visualization components
5. Real-time updates when new predictions are available
6. Dark/light mode support
7. Accessibility compliance

### Backend
1. API endpoints to serve prediction data
2. Data processing for filtering and sorting
3. Authentication system (optional for future expansion)
4. Integration with the prediction system's data output
5. Performance optimization for handling large datasets
6. Scheduled jobs to update prediction data

### Data Integration
1. Read prediction data from the Neural Network-Based Sports Predictor
2. Process and transform data for web display
3. Store historical performance data
4. Implement caching for improved performance
5. Handle data updates when new predictions are generated

## Implementation Approach
- Use Next.js for the full-stack application
- Implement server-side rendering for improved performance
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement responsive design for all device sizes
- Use chart libraries for data visualization (Recharts or similar)
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Ensure code modularity and maintainability

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. User accounts and personalization
2. Email notifications for high-confidence predictions
3. Comparison with actual PrizePicks lines
4. Social sharing capabilities
5. Advanced analytics dashboard
6. API access for third-party integration
